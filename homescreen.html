    <h2>Why Organ Transplantation Matters</h2>
    <p>Organ transplantation is a medical procedure that saves lives by replacing a damaged or failing organ with a healthy one from a donor. It is a remarkable achievement of modern medicine, providing hope to patients suffering from organ failure due to various medical conditions, including heart disease, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, and more. Organ transplantation can dramatically improve the quality of life and extend the lifespan of recipients.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>While organ transplantation offers hope, it also comes with significant challenges, such as a shortage of donor organs, ethical considerations, and the need for better organ preservation techniques. Our project is dedicated to addressing these challenges and finding innovative solutions to improve the accessibility and success of organ transplantation.</p>
